For this project, I implemented a program to encode text using Huffman coding. Huffman coding is a
method of lossless (the original can be reconstructed perfectly) data compression. Each character is assigned a
variable length code consisting of ’0’s and ’1’s. The length of the code is based on how frequently the character
occurs; more frequent characters are assigned shorter codes.
